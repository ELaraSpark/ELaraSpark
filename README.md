👋 Hi, I’m @ELaraSpark – always debugging life one line at a time!

👀 I’m interested in turning coffee (well, not really, I don’t drink it) and code into websites, smart contracts, and cool games.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to 'console.log' my way through Solidity and wrangling variables in game design.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that don’t throw exceptions—preferably fun ones involving programming education or AI that won't crash and burn!

📫 How to reach me: Just 'Ctrl+F' me online!

😄 Pronouns: She/Her (or if you prefer: 'const Elara = { pronouns: "She/Her" };')

⚡ Fun fact: My life’s a loop, but I’m always breaking out of it to write Seuss-style poems!

🔧 Favorite tool: My 'if' statements—they fix all my problems (or at least catch them)!

🖥️ Coding superpower: I can 'git' it done, even when I forget to save.

🧩 Current obsession: Trying to find the missing semicolon in life.

🐱 Pet project: Building a game that’s 90% bugs and 10% fun—just like real life!

🧠 Bug or feature? I’ll let you decide!

🚀 Goal: To refactor my life like I refactor my code—cleaner and more efficient.

💡 Life motto: “Keep calm and clear your cache.”
